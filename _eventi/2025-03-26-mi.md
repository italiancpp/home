### Le sessioni

#### The Use of modern C++ in Firmware and Embedded Software

Relatore: **Antonio Marullo** - Senior Embedded Software Engineer at Capgemini

Over the past decade, C++ has undergone substantial evolution in firmware and embedded software development, progressively establishing itself as a critical programming language across various industrial sectors. This presentation will explore the language's current capabilities, delve into its practical implementation challenges, and provide insights into advanced techniques for optimizing C++ in resource-constrained embedded environments.

#### Enhancing C++ Development: How Tools Can Help You Write Better Code

Relatore: **Francesco Cusolito** - Senior Embedded Software Engineer at Capgemini

"Developing in C++ is risky. Writing safe C++ code is difficult and time-consuming.
It's 2025 ‚Äî maybe it's time to let computers help us write code more easily, reducing risks and speeding up development. And who knows? We might even learn something along the way.

I want to introduce you to some powerful tools that you can start using right away, seamlessly integrating them into your development workflow. We'll explore linters, static analysis tools, formatters, instrumented builds, and more ‚Äî because writing C++ doesn‚Äôt have to be a constant struggle."
