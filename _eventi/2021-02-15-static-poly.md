Meetup **solo online** a causa dell'emergenza sanitaria.

Gli incontri sono ospitati su Remo e la sessione pu√≤ essere rivista su YouTube.

### La sessione

Static polymorphism is a very powerful tool in C++, albeit sometimes cumbersome to obtain.
How well do you really know it though? Are you ready for a journey into the rabbit hole to discover the darkest corners of language?

We will see two of the most famous libraries, understand the strengths and weaknesses of their approaches, then take a look at a third proposal that tries to combine the best of both worlds.

### Il relatore

Michele Caini.
