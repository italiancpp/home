🥳 Exciting news in town: the Italian C++ Community is organizing a new C++ meetup in Milan!

At this event, **Dietmar Kühl**, Software Engineer at Bloomberg, will show us how to develop an HTTP server using the new sender/receiver framework, set to become standard in C++26. The session will be fully hands-on and interactive.

📌Where? Hosted at the [Bloomberg LP office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BVSVhfDPANnLBwsE6), in Piazza Fontana 🤩

🎙️ Special Feature: Dietmar Kühl will lead the session “Creating a Sender/Receiver HTTP Server”

🍕 Bloomberg will offer an aperitivo afterward to encourage networking

🆓 Participation is completely free, but registration is required.

### Session details

**Creating a Sender/Receiver HTTP Server**

Relatore: **Dietmar Kühl** - Software Engineer in Bloomberg

The sender/receiver framework for asynchronous operations in C++ is well on its way towards standardization in C++26. Previously, the theoretical background and implementation of the framework was shown but there wasn't much detail on how an application using sender/receiver would look like.

This presentation shows how to create a simple HTTP server using the sender/receiver framework with matching networking senders together with a coroutine task and and async scope. The code is created live using fundamental facilities. The goal is to demonstrate that the use of an asynchronous framework doesn't necessarily lead to excessive complexity when using C++'s facilities effectively. The resulting server could be embedded into any application, e.g., to inspect its state or change configurations. The takeaway is that it is reasonably straight forward to create an asynchronous program.

### About the speaker

Dietmar Kühl is a senior software developer at Bloomberg working on the data distribution environment used both internally and by enterprise installations at clients. In the past, he has done mainly consulting for software projects in the finance area. He is a regular attendee of the ISO C++ standards committee and frequent presenter at conferences.
