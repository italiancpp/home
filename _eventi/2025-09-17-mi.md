### La sessione

**È giunta l'ora di `<ranges>`**

When and how to use assertions has always been a controversial topic. Assertions (and more recently contracts) are a way to enforce requirements at the cost of halting the whole program. Though there are ways to mitigate this problem, it cannot be solved entirely.
What if I could enforce contracts at compile time? I would get rid of the random crashes a failed assertion would cause and all the contracts in my code would be satisfied providing a safer and more robust executable.

### Il relatore

Massimiliano Pagani - Lead Flight Software Engineer at D-Orbit

Max started coding back in the 80s when computers were laughably slow, never had enough RAM, and used tape recorders as storage memory. Since then, he never stopped writing bugs and other features. He worked in the video game industry, had some exposure to server and service development, got fascinated by functional programming, and spent several years writing firmware and embedded software in C++ (and C). Nowadays he leads a team of software engineers working on satellite flight software. When Max is struck by something he reckons interesting, and has enough spare time, he writes on his blog at https://www.maxpagani.org/
