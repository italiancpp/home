Last June 17 we had the Italian C++ Conference 2017 in Milan, one of the events totally focused on C++ organized by the **Italian C++ Community** that I lead and manage. **~230 people signed up** for the conference and about **160 attended**. We are really disappointed about the drop rate (~30% – higher than usual). Probably, the nationalwide transport strike that happened in Italy the day before did a number on the conference.

The event was hosted at [Università Bicocca of Milan](http://www.unimib.it).

The event was **the biggest one I ever organized**: **160 attendees**, **7 sponsors**, **10 technical sessions** splitted into two tracks, a panel on **diversity and inclusion** and, above all, **no budget**! Indeed, the event was **totally free** and realized thanks to the support of the sponsors and me and my staff’s willingness. I love spending a good part of my spare time (and also some nights) on organizing free meetups, activities and events for people who want to join the ecosystem.

I really enjoyed the event, the vibes were great and I met many new people!

#### Structure and contents of the event

The Italian C++ Conference 2017 in numbers:

*   8×60′ (parallel) technical sessions
*   1×75′ (plenary) keynote
*   1×45′ session on diversity and inclusion

*   130′ allocated for breaks and networking

We had two plenaries (the keynote and the session on Diversity and Inclusion by Microsoft) and two parallel tracks (one in Italian and the other in English).

Our outstanding keynote speaker **Michael Wong** talked about C++ executors to enable heterogeneous computing in tomorrow’s C++ today.

#### Feedback

This time **~60% of attendees gave feedback**. It’s been very good so far and I’d like showing you some charts (1 corresponds to the minimum rate, 5 to the maximum):

#### #itCppCon17 and gifts

As usual, we set up a social contest and awarded the “best tweets” with hashtag **#itCppCon17**.

Thanks to [O’Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/) and [Manning](https://manning.com) for the free books!

#### What’s next?

Well, my mind is already heading towards the second annual event that we usually organize: the **C++ Day**. My staff and I would like to make it happen in Bologna or Modena by December…we’ll keep you posted! If you are keen on helping or sponsoring please [get in touch](../../../../chi-siamo/contattaci.html).

**Thanks to all!**
