# 5 years of italiancpp

Time flies. Today of 5 years ago I officially launched this website to the world.

Happy birthday ++it üôÇ

I believe that 5 years is a great milestone. When I started the community, from scratch, my network was relatively small and I didn‚Äôt have any previous experience in managing something other than a small project developed in the spare time with a few friends.

I didn‚Äôt care about the difficulties I would have face with, I was pumped for this new adventure and I just wanted to go live and put myself on the line.

A community is about people and I‚Äôd like to say **thank you** to all the people who have joined and supported the Italian C++ Community during the last 5 years. Some people have been very important for this tribe, in particular the staff members helping behind the scenes. At the very beginning I started with **Franco Milicchio**, **Raffaele Rialdi**, **Stefano Saraulli**, **Alfredo Di Napoli** and **Davide Di Gennaro**. Along the way other great people joined the group. It‚Äôs worth mentioning in particular **Alessandro Vergani**, **Guido Pederzini**, **Marco Foco**, **Illya Dudchenko** and **Gian Lorenzo Meocci**. Thank you all!

I would like to recall some numbers and important dates:

* Website officially born on March 26, 2013
* Public announcement on June 24, 2013 
* First public appearance of the community on February 26, 2014 at Community Days, where we looked after an entire track about C++. 50 people attended
* First meetup on June 28, 2014, half-day + lunch. 30 attendees
* Last event: ‚ÄúItalian C++ Conference 2018‚Äù on June 23, 2018. 200 attendees
* Total number of events organized: 15
* Total number of events attendees: 1040
* Newsletter subscribers: 1000+

For the last 5 years, our commitment has been spreading around C++ best-practices and good resources, and connecting people with the Italian C++ ecosystem through the online community and events. We have organized events, given dozen of talks, facilitated workshops and produced articles and tutorials about C++, connected with other communities and events (not only about C++).

I feel like sharing some words about the story of the community.

#### When and why everything started

In 2012, while I was watching Going Native 2012, I started wondering why we didn‚Äôt use to have events about C++ in Italy. We had dozen of conferences every year about other topics but C++. We didn‚Äôt have any user group neither.

Then, a very ‚Äúsimple‚Äù idea started forming in my mind: ‚ÄúI want to organize an event about C++ in Italy‚Äù. My target was not so ambitious, I thought.

The first thing I asked myself was ‚ÄúWhat do I need to make an event?‚Äù. I thought a bit and then I answered ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù. That was my very first naive thought. That was true: **events come with people**. Management, logistics, money, badges, etc come afterwards. I needed to get **people** involved**.**

Then I decided to start _something_, with a low profile. I made two social groups, inspired by ‚ÄúC++ Enthusiasts‚Äù ‚Äì a Facebook group that was really popular at that time and I made a Facebook and a Linkedin group about **C++ in Italy**.

‚ÄúHow do I call such groups?‚Äù I asked myself.

‚ÄúWhat about **++it**?‚Äù I thought.

**++it**, condenses everything: **it** recalls both _Italy_ and the classical _iterator_ name ‚Äì a typical C++ concept. The prefix **++** is for both C++ and also for advancing such an iterator in a C++ish manner ‚Äì as opposite to it++. ‚ÄúI like it!‚Äù It was love at first sight. Probably a rare case of me being exactly right at naming!

Anyway, we were at the end of 2012 and such groups did not achieve a resounding success. I used to share news and resources about C++ on the groups but they were missing something fundamental: **Community**. They were just cold groups. A Community is made up of people and relations. A community needs to be fed, continuously.

Dropping a few comments about articles and videos was not about building up a community.

A few months passed. At the beginning of 2013 I didn‚Äôt have time nor mind to think about my project: my mum passed away on Feb 2.

I took a few weeks for myself and then I gave me two options: giving up or turning around.

I chose the latter, as you know because you are reading this article.

I‚Äôve always thought that, in a sense, my loss drove my commitment. Maybe my life needed to compensate, somehow.

Then I started, seriously. I put 100% of myself into the project, into the **ideal**.

On March 26th I bought the domain _italiancpp.org_.

Afterwards, I spent some time **writing down a mission and setting up targets** for my community. Although ++it has never been part of my job, I‚Äôve took it professionally from the beginning. I think this point has been very important for the evolution of the community.

The community‚Äôs mission is:

*   spreading C++ in Italy by promoting news and resources;
*   involving and connecting people interested in C++;
*   supporting and helping beginners and students with C++;
*   easing relationships between companies and people interested in C++;
*   making events and meetups about C++.
In a few words: \*\*++it‚Äôs mission is to be the C++ landmark in Italy\*\*.

The rest of the story might be covered in future articles.

#### ++it Rejuvenation

I‚Äôd like to spend a few words on the massive ‚Äúrefactoring‚Äù I did in Summer 2016.

In 2016, after 3 years of experience with ++it, I developed a new vision on how to deliver contents and offer interactions to my tribe.

If you used to be a ++it user before that time, you remember we had a forum. Running statistics on the usage, I noticed it was more or less unused or visited mostly by beginners. But actually, people loved discussing in several other channels like facebook, emails, etc.

I started elaborating this idea of making ++it an **aggregator of ways to interact**. I coined the term **interaction proposals:** as a community leader, I basically offer to my tribe several ways to communicate, interact and build up relationships, **all at the very same level**. It‚Äôs up to them which one(s) to use, I cannot decide for themselves. My task is to make all such proposals at the **same experience level**. At that time, the forum was my first citizen choice. That was a mistake.

In addition, I worked a bit on setting up a more modern and engaging theme. The final result has been online since August 2016.

At the end, I got rid of the forum and then I disabled the registration of users (they can only subscribe Slack and the newsletter). I replaced the forum with a dedicated subreddit and put more effort and moderation on Slack channels. The forum is not the central point of the community anymore. In addition, I worked on a [code of conduct](https://github.com/italiancpp/code-of-conduct).

Here are the **activities** and the **interaction proposals** of the community:

*   Social channels (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin)
*   Slack team
*   Subreddit
*   Articles
*   Newsletter
*   Job offers
*   Events, meetups and other social activities

Moreover, I set up a bit of **automation** among some of the channels above. This way **all the interaction proposals have exactly the same rank and importance**. People won‚Äôt miss updates just because they don‚Äôt use Slack, for instance.

For example, when I tweet adding the hashtag #_news,_ a bot spreads the same content to Facebook and Slack. Also, the full stream of filtered tweet will be sent via newsletter at the end of the month. I could cover this automation in a future post, if you are interested.

#### Next plans

‚Äú5 years have passed. What‚Äôs next?‚Äù

You know, when you reach such milestones, you have to look at the future and set the next milestone(s).

Not being conceited, I think my originary targets have been achieved: **++it is the C++ landmark in Italy**. I am glad when people tell me that ++it has been useful for finding job opportunities or important connections, when I read amazing discussions on Slack, and when students find help. Moreover, it‚Äôs very significant that companies ask my support for recruitment in the italian C++ ecosystem.

**I have not mentioned that I have developed a simple program to help companies find C++ developers. If you are a company and you need such a service**, [please visit this page](https://www.italiancpp.org/jobs/) (it‚Äôs in Italian, though).

During the years, I have refined my original vision on ++it by introducing **interaction proposals**, I have previously described. From one hand, I have worked a lot on the platform/website itself by aggregating digital services and communication channels like reddit or Slack. However, I believe I need to put more effort on **openness**. Let me explain.

My next target is to reinforce the concept of **++it as an** **aggregator** **of activities and events not directly organized by our core team**. Basically, **++it will help people make activities, meetups and events about C++ in Italy**.

++it will patronize such events by flanking organizers and will offer visibility, network and advertisement. **After 5 years we have experience and network to empower willing people who want to make C++ activities in our country**. I feel lonely at doing monthly C++ meetups in Modena! Why not having meetups in Milan, Rome or Florence?

As I announced yesterday at the **Italian C++ Conference 2018**, the very first experiment of this model is the organization of the **C++ Day 2018**, expected for November 24th in Pavia, which has been in the pipeline for some months, driven by **Riccardo Brugo** and **Federico Pasqua**, willing students at University of Pavia. I‚Äôve been supporting such good guys for some time but the biggest part of the job is on their shoulders. I will join the full organization during Summer.

Adopting this model, I imagine the following activities:

*   (at least) 1 event per year fully organized by the core-staff (e.g. Italian C++ Conference);
*   (at least) 1 season of monthly meetups set where I live (Modena, at the moment);
*   any number of meetups and events patronized by ++it but not 100% organized by the core-staff;
*   usual core tasks like managing the community, selecting resources and news, making the newsletter, etc still ~100% on me.

If you are interested in running events, activities or meetups about C++ in Italy, even small ones, please [get in touch](https://www.italiancpp.org/chi-siamo/contattaci/). ++it and I will be very happy to help and give support!

I have written [this page](https://www.italiancpp.org/organize/) (in Italian) with more details.
