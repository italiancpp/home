And here's the traditional "Happy Birthday" song, sung by all of us in honor of C++:

#### Issues

No major issues were reported; the venue provided a professional environment with comfortable spaces for talks, networking, and catering.

The only issue (and a lesson for both us and the host) was that the support screens, intended to help attendees in the back see the slides, were positioned too low, making them difficult to view properly.

#### Feedback

About 30% of attendees gave feedback (this is aligned with last time, in 2023) and we are glad the results were very good. In addition, all the talks were appreciated, getting high rates.
