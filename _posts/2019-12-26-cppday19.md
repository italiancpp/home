On November 30th, we had an awesome day about C++ in Parma: the [C++ Day 2019](https://italiancpp.org/cppday19). We co-organized this event with [Elettric80](https://www.elettric80.com/it/). The event was hosted by the [University of Parma](https://www.unipr.it/)!

The **C++ Day 2019** had **~170 attendees**.

The event was possible thanks to the joint work of **Elettric80** and a few people from the **Italian C++ Community** (**Alessandro Vergani**, **Illya Dudchenko, Federico Ficarelli** and I) and the **University of Parma**.

That’s all about the **C++ Day** format: a joint effort between the Italian C++ Community and one or more local hosts. As I told during my welcome and closing messages, the **call for C++ Day 2020** is open! Two things are needed:

*   an event location with at least 2 rooms with 150 seats each and some space for catering and sponsor stands. Possibly free;
*   some support to co-organize the event. If you are interested, [let’s speak about it](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec85828a83ac85988d80858d828f9c9cc2839e8b)!

In addition to Elettric80, the **C++ Day 2019** had two other supportive companies which I would like to thank:

*   [Beckhoff](https://beckhoff.com/)
*   [Leica Geosystems](https://leica-geosystems.com/)

Last but not least, **thanks to all the speakers and to all the attendees**!

I have published several pictures of the event [here on our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/italiancpp/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2426964104284958).

#### Structure and contents of the event

The **C++ Day 2019** was a full-day event about C++ development with 8×50′ and 2×30′ talks arranged in two parallel tracks throughout the whole day, 1×45′ Q&A Panel.

Networking and breaks: 1h before the kick-off, 2×30′ breaks (1 morning, 1 afternoon) and 75′ lunch break. Food, hot and cold beverages available through all the event.

The Main Theme of the event was **C++ in Industrial Automation.** 

Some topics:

*   Cross-compilation in C and C++
*   Python bindings in C++
*   STL algorithms design
*   TBB Dataflow
*   Design patterns and idioms in C++ use cases
*   MISRA C++
*   Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms in C++
*   From iterators to ranges

Most of the talks were in Italian.

#### Feedback

This year we had less than 30% of the attendees giving feedback.

#### What’s next

The organization of the **Italian C++ Conference 2020** has already started. It will be in **Rome** and the [call for sessions](https://italiancpp.org/itcppcon20) is open. If you would like to support the event, get in touch.

In 2020 I will keep on arranging **monthly C++ meetups in Modena**, hosted by [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org) (which I have been recently joined the official council).

In addition, I will keep on directing [Coding Gym](https://coding-gym.org) and, as a trainer, I will keep on organizing **Coding Gym** in Modena on a monthly basis.

That’s all. See you in 2020!
