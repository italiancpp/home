Two weeks ago, on November 24th, we had an awesome day about C++ in Pavia: the [C++ Day 2018](https://italiancpp.org/cppday18). We co-organized this event with the University of Pavia and in particular with two proactive guys: **Riccardo Brugo** and **Federico Pasqua**. The event was hosted by the [Physics Department](http://fisica.unipv.it/) and by the director **Alberto Rotondi** which actively supported the C++ Day. Many thanks to all the people involved and to the university!

The **C++ Day 2018** had **~110 attendees**, like the previous edition in Modena.

The event was possible thanks to a joint effort between a few people from the **Italian C++ Community** staff (**Alessandro Vergani**, **Illya Dudchenko** and I) and the local hosts Riccardo, Federico and the Physics Department of the University of Pavia.

That’s all about the **C++ Day** format: a joint effort between the Italian C++ Community and a local host. As I told during my welcome and closing messages, the **call for C++ Day 2019** is open! The **C++ Day** needs two things:

*   an event location with at least 2 rooms with 150 seats each and some space for catering and sponsor stands. Possibly free;
*   some support to co-organize the event. Let’s speak about it.

If you are keen on hosting the C++ Day 2019, please [get in touch](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84edeae2ebc4edf0e5e8ede5eae7f4f4aaebf6e3)! And if you have just questions, ask!

The **C++ Day 2018** had two sponsors which I would like to thank again:

*   [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/it-it/careers?src=JB-33963), which has many job opportunities published on our [jobs page](https://www.italiancpp.org/jobs/);
*   [Bartek Stories](https://www.bfilipek.com/)

Last but not least, **thanks to all the speakers and to all the attendees**!

I have published several pictures of the event [here on our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/italiancpp/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2140877512893620).

#### Some stats

We have some stats, as usual.

#### Structure and contents of the event

The **C++ Day 2018** was a full-day event about C++ development with 1×90′ keynote and talks arranged in two parallel tracks throughout the whole day: 8×50′ talks and 2×20′ short talks.

Networking and breaks: 1h before the kick-off, 2×30′ breaks (1 morning, 1 afternoon) and 90′ lunch break. We served snacks, coffee and drinks during both the breaks and we could even offer a full meal at the university restaurant to everyone thanks to the sponsorships.

Less than half of the talks were in English ([slides here](https://github.com/italiancpp/cppday18) and videos still to be published). **John Biddiscombe** gave the keynote [HPX : High performance computing in C++ with concurrency parallelism and futures](../../../../cppday18-talks/index.html#1), very appreciated according to the feedback received. Other talks were about several other topics like C++20, GIS in C++, Optimization, Templates, Reflection, AI, Algorithms, …Check out the [event page](../../../../event/cppday18/index.html) for more details.

#### Feedback

As it usually happens, about 50% of attendees gave feedback. I am personally very happy about the results.

#### Best #cppDay18 tweets

Our events come with prizes only for “best tweets”. The definition of “best tweet” is _unspecified_ though…A few are listed below:

#### What’s next

We are diving into the organization of the **Italian C++ Conference 2019.** It will be in Milan, as usual, but we don’t have a confirmed setting yet, so we are considering alternative locations. If you know one, please [get in touch](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e676068614e677a6f62676f606d7e7e20617c69)!

In 2019 I will keep on arranging **monthly C++ meetups in Modena**, hosted by [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org) (which I have been recently joined the official council).

In addition, I am putting a lot of effort and time to direct [Coding Gym](https://coding-gym.org) that we will bring to new cities in 2019. As a trainer, I will keep on organizing **Coding Gym** in Modena on a monthly basis.

**Coding Gym** is a place where we practice _expressing ourselves_ through programming and collaboration. I put emphasis on “_expression of ourselves”_ because it’s what I consider our most important thing as human beings. If you like knowing more about **Coding Gym**, just come over. If you cannot, visit [the website](https://coding-gym.org) or drop me an email ($myName \[at\] italiancpp \[dot\] org).

That’s all. See you in 2019!
