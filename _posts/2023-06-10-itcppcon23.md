Last June 10th we finally got back in person for a fantastic [Italian C++ Conference 2023](http://italiancpp.org/itcppcon23)! The greatest event about C++ in Italy, reaching its 7th edition, this year took place in Rome (at Università "Roma Tre") and hosted 207 attendees.

Here is the classical wrap-up post.

Some information:

*   the event was totally **free** to attend

The conference was organized by **Marco Arena** and **Franco Milicchio**. The rest of the staff: **Stefano Saraulli**, **Vincenzo Pelosio**, **Riccardo Brugo**, **Alberto Barbati**, **Alessandro Vergani**.

#### How the virtual event was made

This event was made as the C++ Day 2020, so please refer to [this previous article](https://www.italiancpp.org/cppday20/) to learn how it was made. Do not hesitate to [get directly in touch](mailto:info@italiancpp.org) with us if you want to know more or if you need our support.

Please consider that other organizers are moving to different platforms like [Gather](https://www.gather.town/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Hopin](https://hopin.com/), [AirMeet](https://www.airmeet.com/), [Wonder](http://wonder.me/). I personally have some experience with almost all of them (as organizer, speaker and guest) but I still think that, it being understood that Italian C++ Community has **no budget** and runs one-day events only, Remo is still the best choice.

_Edit:_ the C++ foundation has ended its contract with Remo, so we have to find other ways to host online events.

#### Feedback

Online events make harder for organizers to get feelings about what is going on. You cannot just go around and sense other people’s vibes. When online, you have to get some casual feedback by having a word with people during breaks or at the end of the conference. However, this is not always spontaneous.

I think the general feedback was good and I have sensed better feelings than the C++ Day 2020. We had too few people filling up the feedback survey, but in case you are interested here are the results:

#### What’s next

We have already planned the meetups (online) for the end of 2021. **They are all in English**. You will find them on the [homepage](http://italiancpp.org/). At this moment we do not have a hosting platform other than YouTube (very likely, we won’t have networking).

We are discussing about the C++ Day 2021. We will take a decision by a few weeks. It cannot be in person, though.

We all need help for all our activities. I know that committing to non-profit activities is not for everyone and that requires people of good will. Are you getting some benefit from our activities? It’s time to give back. **Please get in touch directly with us if you want to help.**

Stay safe. Hope to see you soon!
