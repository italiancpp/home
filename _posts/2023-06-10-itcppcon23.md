Last June 10th we finally got back in person for a fantastic [Italian C++ Conference 2023](http://italiancpp.org/itcppcon23)! The greatest event about C++ in Italy, reaching its 7th edition, this year took place in Rome (at Università "Roma Tre") and hosted 207 attendees.

Here is the classical wrap-up post.

Some information:

*   the event was totally **free** to attend
*   total number of registrants: **276**
*   total number of attendees: **207**
*   drop rate (percentage of registered people not showing up) ~25%

The conference was organized by **Marco Arena** and **Franco Milicchio**. The rest of the staff: **Stefano Saraulli**, **Vincenzo Pelosio**, **Riccardo Brugo**, **Alberto Barbati**, **Alessandro Vergani**. The day of the conference we had also some help from **Federico Ficarelli**, **Federico Pasqua**, **Ruben Vergani**, **Giacomo Angelucci**, **Davide Stefani**. Thank you all!

The conference has **7 sponsors** which covered the event costs. Many thanks to:

#### Structure and contents of the event

The **Italian C++ Conference 2023** was a one-day event about C++ development with 10x50-min and 2x30-min talks arranged in two parallel tracks throughout the whole day (from 9 AM to 6 PM).

On the day before, we organized the traditional "speakers and staff dinner", hosted at *Flavio al Velavevodetto*, a famous restaurant in Rome, hosting all the speakers and staff members:

This year was a bit special since we celebrated Italian C++ Community's 10-year anniversary! Thus, Marco Arena's welcome message was a bit longer than usual, he played a [special video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dnr4o0DGbA) and spent some words about his 10-year community experience:

In addition, [think-cell] offered a cake during the lunch break. It was a lovely moment!

Networking and breaks: 2×35-min breaks (one in the morning and one in the afternoon, both with free food and drinks), and 75-min lunch break.

The whole [agenda](https://italiancpp.github.io/con23#agenda) was in English ([slides here](https://github.com/italiancpp/itcppcon23) and [videos here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeLPeuQ5-TI&list=PLsCm1Hs016LWmLbXL7in73BgB9AhMrfDa)).

Topics:

- C++23 features
- Unreal Engine in C++
- Game Development
- Code optimization
- Compilation times optimization
- C++ in safetey-critical environments

#### Issues

This year we had a few issues that are worth mentioning, in particular to apologise to the attendees and speakers.

First of all, the audio and video equipment in the rooms were really bad (in room N10 in particular), causing poor projection and audio quality. We had to switch most of the lights off in the rooms to improve (just a bit) the visibility. Also, the microphone was often flickering. The recordings were better, at least regarding the video quality, whereas on the audio we improved it a bit by using some post-processing tools. It's not perfect for all the videos but acceptable. We needed more tests in advance.

Another problem was the air conditioning system. An problem we had in 2019 as well (you remember?). We deserve more luck here!
Basically, we had to solicit the university multiple times to have the system working properly. Everything was planned already but, apparently, someone didn't know about the conference! The system started working properly at about 11 AM.

Last but not least, the space for the catering was too small and this caused a long line for grabbing food, especially at lunch. Here, we have underestimated the number of people attending.

Our apologies to all the people affected. We are committed to doing better next time.

Everytime we have something to learn!

#### Feedback

Online events make harder for organizers to get feelings about what is going on. You cannot just go around and sense other people’s vibes. When online, you have to get some casual feedback by having a word with people during breaks or at the end of the conference. However, this is not always spontaneous.

I think the general feedback was good and I have sensed better feelings than the C++ Day 2020. We had too few people filling up the feedback survey, but in case you are interested here are the results:

#### What’s next

We have already planned the meetups (online) for the end of 2021. **They are all in English**. You will find them on the [homepage](http://italiancpp.org/). At this moment we do not have a hosting platform other than YouTube (very likely, we won’t have networking).

We are discussing about the C++ Day 2021. We will take a decision by a few weeks. It cannot be in person, though.

We all need help for all our activities. I know that committing to non-profit activities is not for everyone and that requires people of good will. Are you getting some benefit from our activities? It’s time to give back. **Please get in touch directly with us if you want to help.**

Stay safe. Hope to see you soon!
