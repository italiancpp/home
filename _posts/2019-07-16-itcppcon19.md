The 4th edition of the Italian C++ Conference took place at Politecnico di Milano last June 15th.

The awesome day opened with a very special keynote by **Andrei Alexandrescu**.

The conference was attended by **~240 people**, 20% more than last year. The drop rate was about 23%, slightly higher than last year.

As always, I have co-organized the conference with **Alessandro Vergani**. In addition, the staff on-site included: Guido Pederzini, Raffaele Rialdi, Illya Dudchenko, Gian Lorenzo Meocci, Federico Ficarelli. Thank you guys!

Some news: first of all, the conference was hosted for the first time at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), which I would like to thank. In addition, since I have recently co-founded a not-for-profit association – [Community Crumbs](https://communitycrumbs.org/) – attendees could optionally donate to help cover the main costs.

As usual, **the conference was totally free**. We could rely on some companies and some donations to cover the event costs (slightly less than 8’000 €):

*   Coffee break in the morning, lunch and some beverages in the afternoon (~4’300 €)
*   Video recordings and technicians (~1’000 €)
*   Air conditioning – oddly enough, that’s not free (~800 €)
*   Badges, stickers and some other gadgets (~300 €)
*   Staff & Speakers dinner (~800 €)

I would like to thank all the companies which supported the conference: [KDAB](https://kdab.com/), [JFrog/Conan](https://conan.io/), [AIV](https://www.aiv01.it/), [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com/), [Sigeo](http://www.sigeosrl.com/), [Develer](https://www.develer.com/), [Hexagon](https://leica-geosystems.com/). Moreover, a big shout-out to 32 people who donated (~10% of the total number of registrants).

#### Structure and contents of the event

The **Italian C++ Conference 2019** was a full-day event about C++ development with 1×90′ keynote and talks arranged in two parallel tracks throughout the whole day: 8×50′ talks, 2×30′ short talks and one 20-min featured talk during lunch.

Networking and breaks: 1h before the kick-off, 2×30′ breaks (1 morning, 1 afternoon) and 75′ lunch break. We offered a coffee break in the morning and a lunch meal. In the afternoon, beverages were available for free.

The whole agenda was in English ([slides here](https://github.com/italiancpp/itcppcon19) and [videos here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxwKAX7p8GE&list=PLsCm1Hs016LU5PDVL3Hxgtuim_IIN4ajw)). **Andrei Alexandrescu** gave an awesome keynote [Allegro Means Both Fast and Happy. Coincidence?](https://youtu.be/zxwKAX7p8GE). Other talks were about several other topics like C++20 (Modules, Concepts, Coroutines), Cross-platform development, Link time and profile guided optimization, CONAN C++ package manager, Entity Component System pattern. Check out the [event page](../../../../event/itcppcon19.html) for more details including links to videos and slides.

#### Best #itCppCon19 tweets

Our events come with prizes only for “best tweets”. The definition of “best tweet” is _unspecified_ though…A few are listed below:

#### What’s next

We have already started the co-organization of the **C++ Day 2019**. We are just waiting for the official confirmation from the university but it should be in **Parma on November 30**. Save the date! The call for sessions will hopefully open in a few weeks. The event is co-organized with the **Robotics Team** of the **University of Parma**.

I am looking for speakers for the second half of the season of monthly **C++ meetups in Modena**, hosted by [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org). If you like to give a talk, moderate a workshop, or moderate a roundtable, etc. please get in touch (myname \[at\] italiancpp \[dot\] org).

I am proud of [Coding Gym](https://coding-gym.org) and I keep on investing time and effort on this project. We have launched the format in two new cities (Bassano Del Grappa and Bari) and we have our yearly “_trainers summit_” on July 27 in Bologna.

As said before, I have co-founded and I am the president of [Community Crumbs](https://communitycrumbs.org), a not-for-profit association. We have lots of work to do on this newborn project.

That’s all. See you soon!
