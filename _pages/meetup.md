# Speak at our monthly meetups

We currently host meetups in both *Modena* and *Milan*. While the organizers may differ, the passion remains the same!

In Milan, we always have an ongoing call for hosts for upcoming meetups, while in Modena, we have a fixed location.

Go to the dedicated page:

- Modena's "call for sessions" page is [here](https://italiancpp.org/modena)
- Milan's "call for sessions and hosts" page is [here](https://italiancpp.org/milan)

**Would you like to host C++ meetups in your own town?** 

Why not join us? We can offer guidance and promote your events within our community and online. [Get in touch](mailto:info@italiancpp.org)
