# Speak at our monthly meetups in Modena or online

The Italian C++ Community has organized monthly meetups in Modena **since 2017**.

Due to the Covid-19 emergency, we are currently organizing **hybrid meetups**. The meetups are physically hosted at [MakeIt Modena](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palestra+Digitale+MakeitModena/@44.6594541,10.8945142,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9604568cf54b2b99?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO1s_vwdvzAhXD_rsIHQL9DoIQ_BJ6BAhoEAU) and can accommodate up to 15 people (due to the current Covid-19 regulations).

Basically, hosting "hybrid" meetups means that:
- up to 25 people attend in person (facemask is recommended but not mandatory);
- the speaker can be either in person or remote;
- the session will be live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNge3iECU0XKjshac_hdejw). Also, a [Slack](https://italiancpp.org/slack) channel is dedicated for interacting online during and after the session.

The meetup starts at **6:30 PM (GMT+1)**, with **1-hour** technical session starting at **7 PM**. After the session, the attendees on site go to a pizzeria nearby, dining all together and having some **networking**.

## Session format

**We welcome any session format**!

The most popular meetup formats we have hosted up to now are:
- **technical session** (classical frontal session)
- **workshop** (the speaker facilitates a practical session where people will put their hands on some code)
-  **moderated round-table** (the speaker moderates an interactive session to debate about a specific topic by asking questions to the audience)
- **live coding** (a structured “no-slides” talk)

For other formats, please choose "Other" and drop some lines in the notes.

## Acceptance

**First come, first served:** we reserve the slot as soon as we receive a proposal. **The date is not 100% binding**: we usually meet **every 2nd Thursday** of each month, but we are flexible to change with some notice.
