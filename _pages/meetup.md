# Speak at our monthly meetups in Modena or online

We are currently organizing **hybrid meetups**. The meetups are physically hosted at [MakeIt Modena](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palestra+Digitale+MakeitModena/@44.6594541,10.8945142,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9604568cf54b2b99?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO1s_vwdvzAhXD_rsIHQL9DoIQ_BJ6BAhoEAU) and can accommodate up to 15 people (due to the current Covid-19 regulations).

Basically, hosting "hybrid" meetups means that:
- up to 15 people attend in person ([green pass](https://www.dgc.gov.it/web/) and face mask are mandatory)
- the speaker can be either in person or remote
- the session is live streamed to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNge3iECU0XKjshac_hdejw) and a [Slack](https://italiancpp.org/slack) channel is dedicated for interaction with remote people

Meetups start at **6:30 PM (GMT+1)**, with **1-hour** technical session starting at **7 PM**. After the session, the attendees there go to a pizzeria nearby, dining all together and having some **networking**.

## Session format

**We welcome any session format**!

The most popular meetup formats we have hosted up to now are:
- **technical session** (classical frontal session)
- **workshop** (the speaker facilitates a practical session where people will put their hands on some code)
-  **moderated round-table** (the speaker moderates an interactive session to debate about a specific topic by asking questions to the audience)
- **live coding** (a structured “no-slides” talk)

**By default**, we assume the speaker submit a proposal for a **technical session** but in case you like setting up something else, please just add some notes about that.

## Acceptance

As soon as we receive a proposal for a certain date, we reserve that date for the speaker who have submitted the proposal. **The date is not 100% binding**: we usually meet **every 2nd Thursday** of each month, but we are flexible to change with some notice.
