- **workshop** (the speaker facilitates a hands-on session);
-  **moderated round-table** (the speaker moderates an interactive session to discuss a specific topic);

### Why hosting a meetup

We believe that the key to thriving in this fast-paced and competitive world is about *making the pie bigger so that everyone can get a slice*.

Hosting a meetup opens up various opportunities:
