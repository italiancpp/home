The Italian C++ Community has organized monthly meetups in Modena (and online) **since 2017**:

- we are hosted at [MakeIt Modena](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palestra+Digitale+MakeitModena/@44.6594541,10.8945142,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9604568cf54b2b99?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO1s_vwdvzAhXD_rsIHQL9DoIQ_BJ6BAhoEAU);
- our location hosts up to **25 people in person**;
- the speaker can be either **in person** or **remote**;
- the session will be live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNge3iECU0XKjshac_hdejw);
- afterwards, we have a booked table at our **pizzeria** of trust for chat and **networking**.

The meetup opens doors at **6:30 PM (GMT+1)**, hosting a **60/90-min** technical session from **7 PM**.

## Session format

**We welcome any session format**!

The most popular meetup formats we have hosted up to now are:
- **technical session** (classical frontal session)
- **workshop** (the speaker facilitates a practical session where people will put their hands on some code)
-  **moderated round-table** (the speaker moderates an interactive session to debate about a specific topic by asking questions to the audience)
- **live coding** (a structured “no-slides” talk)

For other formats, please choose "Other" and drop some lines in the notes.

## Acceptance

**First come, first served:** we reserve the slot as soon as we receive the proposal. **The date is not 100% binding**: we usually meet **every 2nd Thursday** of each month, but we are flexible to change with some notice.
